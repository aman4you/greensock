		<p>The office for the three creatives was found after a few days. The only issue after moving was having to wait for the new company to be registered before sending invoices for our work. Our savings were spent and we faced a few of weeks of ‘going without,’ but visits to the gym were replaced with running up one of Plovdiv’s beautiful hills and meals in restaurants with wonderful home-cooked meals. In many respects, we were blessed and never forgot.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, any delay imaginable was rearing its head and there were unforeseen payments cutting their way through our credit cards. During this period, we were asked by NQ Tuesday to speak at an event. We said we’d talk about ‘Taking Risks’ &ndash; seemed appropriate. NQ Tuesday describe themselves as a “monthly meetup where digital creatives, technology enthusiasts, social media mavericks and anyone else who wants to learn from experts in their field.” They organise presentations in Manchester, England, from “design legends to hometown heroes. Speakers are selected by hero status.”</p>
		<p>In Alex and Sam’s first public talk together, they revealed everything about the recent difficult times and the brave future of Bonne Marque, which could see the pair walking from Plovdiv to Paris to open the new office. The trip is currently being planned. Ask yourself as a client or a future employee of Bonne Marque which creative agency would you rather work with: the one that always plays it safe or the one that walked across a continent to open a new office?</p>
